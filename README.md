You are going to work with the GitHub desktop. This is a simple tool that allows you to easily work with repositories, commit, push and fetch code. It will allow a consistent interface for your GitHub use. To practice, you will create a Brackets repository, build a simple web site and push it to the cloud. You can follow the same steps to build a NetBeans project using the Desktop. <---------------------
